<b><u><h2>Waterfall Cup:</h2></u></b>
<h3><p><A HREF = "https://surreyrugby.co.uk/competition-rugby/boys/waterfall-cup">Click here for information on the Waterfall Cup</a></p></h3>
<p><h3>There will be many Essex teams competing for the Waterfall Cup. In the Waterfall Cup, teams stay in the competition until the final round.Teams are split into various levels based on previous seasonâ€™s results in Surrey tournaments and friendly results submitted. Teams will also have an opportunity to request where they feel they will be best placed, and Surrey will review these requests and place in levels they feel are more appropriate. Teams will then be seeded within each level and drawn into a waterfall or round robin format (depending on the numbers per level). There is an option of 2 qualifying rounds of 6 x 20 min games and 4 full matches within the waterfall format. Finals day will be held at the end of the tournament with all teams for that age group playing at the same venue. The under 13s may come up against tough opponents but, if they play to their full potential, they can dominate.</p></h3>
<b><u><h2>Preparation for next season:</b></u></h2>
<h3>In preparation for the upcoming season, the Bulldogs have been given drills to work through over the summer. These drills were used by coach Helen when she played rugby for England. The drills focus mainly on speed, agility, fitness and handling. This is because before the first pre-season matches, various tests will be conducted to determine who will be on the 1st team for the competitive matches.</h3>
